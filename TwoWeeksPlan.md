# Renting Car Project: Two-Week Plan

## Step 1: Revised Project Calendar
To meet the June 10 deadline, tasks are condensed into 2 weeks, focusing on critical functionality. Non-essential tasks (e.g., extensive testing, extra features) are minimized or deferred. Below is the revised schedule:

### Day-by-Day Task Schedule
The schedule distributes 139 hours across 16 days, including weekends as workable days. Tasks are grouped to balance backend and frontend work, prioritizing the rent-a-car feature (M1) and ensuring authentication (V3) is integrated early.

| **Day**           | **Date**          | **Tasks**                                                                                   | **Hours** |

### Notes
- **Weekend Work**: May 31–June 1 and June 7–8 are treated as workable days.
- **Parallel Work**: Tasks can be split between two developers (e.g., backend vs. frontend).
- **Scope Adjustments**: Simplified dashboard (M3) and reduced testing (E1) ensure feasibility.

### Best Practices
- **SOLID Principles**: Ensure single responsibility in services and clean React components.
- **Debugging**: Add logging in CarService and error boundaries in ApiContext.
- **DynamoDB**: Check key schemas for conflicts in single-table designs.
